## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Before starting this project, i made sure i familiarize myself with the acceptance criteria and understood the requirement.

I also made sure all the asset were in the correct folder. Also made sure that all images are in png and those that are not were converted. The reason for this is because PNG files benefit from lossless compression, meaning that no data is lost when the images are compressed. This makes it easier and smoother to work with image.

## Usage
